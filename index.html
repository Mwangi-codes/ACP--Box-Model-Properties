            Pizza is an Italian, specifically Neapolitan, dish typically consisting of a flat base of leavened wheat-based
            dough topped with tomato, cheese, and other ingredients, baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired
            oven.
            
            The term pizza was first recorded in 997 AD, in a Latin manuscript from the southern Italian town of Gaeta, in Lazio, on
            the border with Campania.
